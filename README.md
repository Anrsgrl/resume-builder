## Features

- Build a professional resume with ease.
- No sign-up required for creating and downloading resumes.
- Multilingual support with initial language options (English and Azerbaijani).
- Data is stored locally in the browser using `localStorage`.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building modern web applications.
- **i18n**: Internationalization for easy language support.
- **Zustand**: A simple, fast state management tool for React.
- **localStorage**: Used for storing data locally in the user's browser to avoid reliance on external servers.

## Localization

The app currently supports English and Azerbaijani languages (i18n). You can easily extend this by adding more language files and updating the `i18n` configuration.

## Security

Data entered by users is stored securely in the browser's `localStorage`. Please refer to the [security documentation](SECURITY.md) for more information about how the data is handled and stored.

## TODO

- Add more templates for different types of resumes.
- Implement resume customization options for users.
- Extend multilingual support with additional languages.
